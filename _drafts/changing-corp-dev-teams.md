 how to make dev teams in big corporates go faster?
 motivation

 the number 1 issue I have seen in the multitude of big non-tech companies I have been around is a subtle problem mostly hidden to management.

Because individuals in management are in general highly motivated individuals committed to improving things. People like this can't understand that the majority of devs/testers etc. sitting at the bottom of their teams essentially gave up a long time ago. they either gave up, or they jsut think "this is the way things are here - and I am comfortable with this, because it's easy for me and changing things would be very hard and I don't believe that I would be rewarded sufficiently for such a momentous effort to help change things around here."

Another feeling is: "we are under pressure to go faster - that means I need to work harder." but they don't realise "this means I need to CHANGE". It's not about working harder it;s about change. and that is hard.
